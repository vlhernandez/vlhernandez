Howdy,my name is Veronica, I make things.

I am an artist & developer who enjoys integrating the creative analog world of pencil and paper with the digital world. In addition to creating in the tech world, I enjoy sewing and dabble a bit with knitting.

This is my personal website where I intend to document all the projects I work on analog and digital.

Above all, I find the greatest joy in making things.
