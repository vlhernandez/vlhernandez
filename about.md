Howdy!
(I don't usually, use that word, but feel I should since I am in Texas)
My name is Veronica, I make things.

I am an artist & developer who enjoys integrating the creative analog world of pencil and paper with the digital world. In addition to creating in the tech world, I enjoy sewing and dabble a bit with knitting.

This is my personal website where I intend to document all the analog and digital projects I work on.  I've been told that I have a bad habit of not celebrating the small wins and that I am overly critical of my own work. For that reason, this site will be a collection of my projects and things I am currently learning. I will not be posting only beautiful finished work; it will also contain my ugly work because I've found that it takes a lot of ugly iterations before I get to something I'm proud of and the biggest sense of accomplishment usually comes from seeing the work evolve.
