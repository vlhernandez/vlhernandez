I actually made this!  By this, I'm talking about this whole site and the content in it.  I feel like I've come a long way.

Two years ago I started on what I like to call my Learning Quest.  I left the my job after almost 12 years. At the time, I felt absolutely no fear about leaving. It was time to start learning something new.  I didn't worry about a gap in my resume, I didn't think about getting a job or whether I was making the right decision. I left on good terms and was excited about my plan to start learning something completely different.  I enrolled in the Communication Design program (aka Graphic Design) at Texas State University and immersed myself in learning about art history, drawing, 2D design, 3D design (not to be confused with working on a computer. This was all physical, working with paper, foam and metal to learn about volume and space), typography, and several other subjects.  After a year of hard work I submitted my portfolio and was officially accepted into the program. I was loving it!

A few months ago I went on an onsite visit to the IBM design studio. It was eye-opening.  While there I realized that I did not want to leave the engineering world behind. I missed being technical.  To satisfy this urge to get back into the technical world, but not leave the art world I decided to change course again and started learning javaScript, HTML and CSS.  This website is the first project I assigned myself.

I made this site using [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/), the "simple, blog aware, static site generator".  My goal was to focus on learning HTML5 and CSS3 better, so that's all I used to build it out and style it.  I'm extremely proud of what I've accomplished and look forward to the day when I read through the code I wrote and see ways of improving it. For now, I will celebrate what I accomplished by using it and posting about what I've learned and made over the past two years as an student, artist and developer!
