This was a project to create a set of five 1.25" round "real" badges (buttons) with simple iconic graphics to be used as awards. The idea is that Foursquare would award these "real" badges for checking-in to specific SXSW events.

The events I chose to illustrate were Developer VIP Party, Coffee Credit, Music Upgrade, Film Upgrade and Book Credit.

One major lesson learned from this project, is when creating buttons, you need to have a very obvious top and bottom to your icons. In my illustrator file I oriented the images on an angle, but when actually making the physical buttons it was very difficult to find the correct angle to match my design.

The second most difficult part of the this project was visualizing the how the color bands would look once placed on an actual rounded button.  Looking at the final buttons, I would make the outer colored band thinner in order to enlarge the icons.  I would also chose to use more vibrant colors. As usual, once printed, the colors I chose look more muted than I planned.
