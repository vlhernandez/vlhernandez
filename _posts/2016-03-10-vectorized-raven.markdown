Recently, a friend of my husband's asked if I could "vectorize" an image of a raven. He wanted to have it in vector form to use as his avatar. It is also a tattoo he's had for a while and holds special significance for him.

These are the two images he provided. Looking at all those curves, it sounded like a good challenge and it <em>definitely</em> was a challenge.

Everyone always assumes you can just pop an image into Illustrator and the program will magically trace it into something that looks finalized. I've never seen auto-trace actually work, but then again I've never spent much time trying to get it to work.

Instead, I took the pen tool and started drawing my curves.  There are several curves within the flames where I had to fight a strong urge to convert them into something more uniform. Since this was an image with strong significance for the owner I didn't want to alter it too much. I think I managed to keep the original essence of the original drawing.
