The goal of this project was to take an existing company research their background and location, then create a logo for them. I chose the restaurant Neptune Oyster (no, I didn't misspell their name, it is Neptune Oyster and not Neptune's).  

I started with some research and created a word list and mind-map of all the ideas that popped into my head.  I tried listing everything without judgement to get as many directions as possible. From there I created about 45 quick thumbnail sketches. ![thumbnail sketches](/img/neptune_thumbs.png).

From my research I learned that Neptune Oyster is located in the Little Italy section of Boston’s North End.  The North End is Boston’s oldest community. The one square mile waterfront community is also home to Paul Revere House and a large part of the Freedom Trail.  According to Boston.com, most visitors go to the North End to eat.

When Jeff Nace (the owner) opened his restaurant in 2005 it was the only seafood restaurant in the Italian neighborhood.  Mr. Nace has never advertised his restaurant; the 3+ hour wait is due to word of mouth. Part of the wait may be due to the very small restaurant, which was described in reviews on boston.menupages.com as a quaint, friendly, informal spot, small and tight “like a Paris Bistro”.  Zagat described the restaurant as casual/upscale with an intimate ambiance, professional staff, and jovial crowd. The restaurant is very small, the bar seats 15 and the tables seat 27. Diners can sit at the marble counter or at small tables with dark red cushioned banquettes.

Neptune Oyster serves at least 12 types of oysters; meals average about $43.  Diners select their oysters from a paper menu similar to ordering sushi. Menu items are also written on framed mirrors above the bar. The restaurant has a large wine list consisting of 86 bottles ranging from $40-$68.

In an interview with Boston Eater in 2014, Mr. Nace described his average diner as intelligent, food savvy, traveling on business and tourists looking for fresh seafood and oysters.

Since this was the first seafood restaurant in Little Italy my goal was to avoid the flourishes and script-like fonts that are normally associated with Italian restaurants. In addition, I needed to avoid color combinations of red, green and white.  Since the restaurant is located in an area known for restaurants, I chose not to include utensils or food related items in the logo. The logo is intended to be bold and elegant, but maintain a casual feel. This is done with thick bold shapes in combination with elegant curves. The name of the restaurant is in Bauer Bodoni Bold Italic, which was chosen for the way the negative space of the logo very loosely mimics the tail and terminal of the letter y. In addition, Bauer Bodoni Bold Italic has an elegant but informal look. The color blue is not normally used for restaurants, but since the restaurant is on the waterfront and the logo includes waves blue was a more natural fit over brown, green, yellow or red that are usually associated with restaurants.

I also created new letterhead and a business card. ![letterhead](/img/letterhead.png)
