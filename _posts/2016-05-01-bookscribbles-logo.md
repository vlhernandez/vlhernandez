I was asked to develop a logo for [Bookscribbles](http://Bookscribbles.com).  Bookscribbles is an app for organizing annotations.  Along with the logo I needed to create a favicon &mdash; the little 16x16 pixel icon that is displayed on the browser tab.

Within the logo we wanted to incorporate a book and a writing instrument, preferably a fountain pen. As usual, I started with some research, brainstorming and word lists.  I read about the different ways people annotate their books and the tools they use such as highlighters, pen, pencil, sticky notes, etc. During this time I tend to draw in and on all notebooks and scraps of paper that may be sitting around me wherever I am.

I mistakenly kept trying to incorporate the Bookscribbles initials until I stepped away and realized I was writing BS everywhere.  We all know no one is going to think Bookscribbles when they see the abbreviation BS. So that idea was quickly scrapped.  I also really wanted to make a stack of books that looked like a capital 'B', but the sketch that was chosen included an open book and a fountain pen nib.

One of the challenges with this project was developing something that would still be recognizable at a tiny 16x16 pixels.  One of the things I had to do often while working was zoom out and ensure I had included enough white space between each component of the logo. Otherwise, what looks great zoomed in on your monitor will turn into an unrecognizable blurry little blob when you it is displayed on the browser's tab (ask me how I know that).
