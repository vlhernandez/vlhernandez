A few weeks ago, I started working on recreating one of my favorite watch faces (the BN0032 Black Steel from Braun). I was attempting to do this with only CSS.  You can see it on my project page [Braun Watch](http://vlhernandez.com/braun-watch).

The idea of drawing with CSS felt like a fun challenge.  As I continued playing with it I kept making new challenges for myself and it quickly moved from drawing with CSS to re-learning 9th grade trigonometry to calculate the angles between the hour and minute hands at different times because I decided I wanted to display the actual time.

After spending some time figuring out angles, I started looking up how other people plotted points around a circle.  When I'm not pressed for time, this (looking up others' solutions) is something I usually leave until I've completed my own project. Otherwise, I end up spending the majority of my time trying to figure out someone else's solution rather than creating my own solution.  Well, that's exactly what happened and part of the reason I almost didn't post this.

The numbers were originally plotted manually, but then while trying to figure out how to place the tick marks around the bezel I saw someone else's solution on [stackoverflow](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/12813573/position-icons-into-circle). I used it to plot the numbers and the dots around the bezel.  There's quite a bit of clean up I need to do and a few other things I'd like to change, for example, the actual Braun watch doesn't have dots around the bezel.  I'd like to change this to littles lines, but then I'd have to go back and figure out the correct amount of rotation for each dash.  I'll leave that for a later date. For now, to keep with my original goal (which I was already forgetting) of posting things I've worked on whether they are good or not, I've posted my [Braun Watch](http://vlhernandez.com/braun-watch)!
