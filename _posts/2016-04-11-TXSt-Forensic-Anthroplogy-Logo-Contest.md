The Forensic Anthropological Society at Texas State University held a logo design contest and I decided to put my newly learned Illustrator skills to the test. The contest had a few guidelines:

1. Choose a color palette that stands out and is unique (a screenshot of 3 suggested colors was provided, bright red, forest green and goldenrod yellow)
2. The logo should be creative and professional
3. Once a winner is decided, the logo becomes property of F.A.S.

I spent some time [researching](http://www.txstate.edu/anthropology/facts/media.html) what forensic anthropologists do and their backgrounds.  I learned that several fields such as chemistry, mathematics, and even computer science all work together to analyze human remains.  One of the most fascinating things I learned is that Texas State University has a ranch, [Forensic Anthropology Research Center at Texas State (FACTS)](http://www.txstate.edu/anthropology/facts/), where researchers study the rate decomposition of donated human corpses. You can read more about the ranch in this Texas Tribune [article](https://www.texastribune.org/2015/07/25/slideshow-body-farm/).

This was my submission:

The following symbols are included in the logo:

1. Native Oak and Laurel leaves.  I did some research on the [Texas State University seal](http://www.txstate.edu/about/history-traditions/texas-state-seal.html) and found that it includes a wreath of native oak leaves to symbolize strength and laurel leaves to symbolize victory in knowledge.

2. Based on the article about the Forensic Anthropology Research Facility in [Evidence Technology Magazine](http://www.evidencemagazine.com/index.php?option=com_content&task=view&id=1759&Itemid=1) I chose to include a skull and microscope to symbolize the different disciplines and tools that are part of the Forensic Anthropological Society.

3. I noticed the key words Recovery, Analysis, and Identification on the [Forensic Anthropology Center at Texas State](http://www.txstate.edu/anthropology/facts/) and included them in the logo.

4. Texas State University faceted five-point star

5. Finally, the words Forensic Anthropological Society, Texas State University and San Marcos, TX were included.


I tried to imagine what the logo would look like on maroon field notebooks or t-shirts and my main regret was using the suggested dark green on maroon. The contrast isn't strong enough and it is difficult to see.  Other than that, I'm pretty happy with my submission.
