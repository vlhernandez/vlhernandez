I own the whole Adobe Creative Suite and while working on a logo for Bookscribbles I decided to take a break and try to learn After Effects &mdash; just for fun. We don't plan on using this GIF since the final Bookscribbles logo is completely different, but it was a fun exercise!

I had several versions of a logo based on sketches I'd made and decided to take three of them and animate a transition between each one. I was hoping I could make it look like pages in a book falling opening and then closing again.  

Creating this GIF required the full spectrum of the art skills I've been building, first pencil and paper to sketch my ideas, the use of Illustrator to build each component (pen, pages and book), After Effects to build the transitions (open, closed and in between), and finally Photoshop to export the animation as a GIF.  AfterEffects was so much fun, but it can very quickly turn into a time sink.  I spent so much time changing the speed of the animation and playing with different transitions. The biggest challenge was the size of the file, when I started I hadn't realized GIFs could get so large. By pulling out some of my transition points and shortening the overall time I managed to bring the file down from 4MB to 161KB.

This was so much fun it left me wanting to animate everything!
