The objective of this project was to create a product name, logo and packaging for 3 types of chocolate, white, milk and dark chocolate.

As usual, I started with research and from there created pages of word lists that included things like:

1. The different historical names for chocolate (kakaw, cacao, xocatl)
2. The origin of chocolate (Ivory Coast, 20&deg; north and south of the equator, 3 variations of tree)
3. Feelings about chocolate (luxury, romantic, medicinal, obsessed)
4. Words to describe it (sweet, creamy, glossy)
5. What it can be served with (strawberries, wine, on a hotel pillow)
6. General facts about chocolate (the smell of chocolate increases Theta brain waves, 400 pounds of cacao beans make 1 pound of chocolate).

Armed with my word lists I started working on different names for the product along with as many variations on those names I could list out:

* E + 20&deg;
* EQ &amp; 20&deg;
* Rok&#333;k&#333;
* Ro&middot;cocoa
* Royal beans
* Choco Royale
* King Cacao
* Theta
* Cocomfort
* Cortes
* Bean-2-Bar

I picked a few names and based on those names I created about 45 thumbnail sketches for logo ideas. ![choco logo thumbs](/img/choco_thumbs.png)

Throughout this process, I was thinking about packaging that would go along with the name and logo.  What I've noticed with most packaging is that the more luxurious brands tend to have tiny packaging with patterns. I'd never created a pattern before and it seemed like a fun challenge so I chose to go with a small box that would allow me to add a pattern that wouldn't feel overwhelming or too cutesy.  Creating the pattern wasn't too difficult, but aligning it on my package was! I was printing on both sides of the paper and found that my printer was off by 1/100th of an inch. You wouldn't think that would be a problem, but it was very noticeable when I cut out my handles. I had to shift everything in my files to ensure perfect alignment when printed.
