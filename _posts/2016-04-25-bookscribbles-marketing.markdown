Recently, I coded up the marketing site for [Bookscribbles](http://Bookscribbles.com).  Bookscribbles is an app for organizing annotations.

I received the [Sketch](https://www.sketchapp.com/) mockup and dove right into coding up the site. I'd never used Sketch before (Illustrator is my tool of choice), but it was pretty intuitive and not too much of a stretch to figure out. It has some great features that make building a website much easier.  For example, when trying to duplicate the gradient used in the mockup, Sketch will generate the CSS gradients for me. AMAZING, such a time-saver! This project was so much fun because the design was complete and didn't require any work. All I had to do was focus on coding it up which is exactly where I've been wanting to focus my learning.  

I recently learned about the CSS3 Flexible Box (flexbox), which I used for this (my) site, and decided to use it again for Bookscribbles. Almost all sections of the Bookscribbles site design were made using flexbox.  What made flexbox fun to use is that child elements can be flex items as well as flex containers. One of the most helpful sites I used for reference is CSS-Tricks [A Complete Guide to Flexbox](https://css-tricks.com/snippets/css/a-guide-to-flexbox/).  Another fun tool for learning about flexbox is this great little game by Thomas Park's [Flexbox Froggy](http://flexboxfroggy.com/).

One thing I've noticed is that if you ask someone to look at your site, the first thing they'll do is pull it up on their phones. For that reason, even though I didn't receive a mobile mockup, I decided to make it responsive.  I did my best to match the mobile view to the style of the original mockup.

My main goal for this site was to have it match up as closely as possible to the mockup. I realized I was reaching that point when I kept clicking on the browser page instead of the Sketch file.  Once the site was live there were a few tweaks we made to the design, but for the most part, it matches the mockup.

Next up on my task list is to complete the logo for this site.  I've iterated through several ideas and think we are approaching a logo we can go with.  You can see a favicon hint in the screenshot above. Stay tuned!
